Before using this program please read all the license files in the 
~/swr-2.0/doc/ directory. Running this program implies understanding
and acceptance of any terms outlined therin.

To run the mud change to your home directory and run the 
startup script by typing:

./run-swr &

To connect to the mud telnet to port 9999. To change the default port you
can either run the startup script using the desired port number as a 
command line argument or edit the script.

You will need to edit the code and recompile it in order to be the
implementor. Look for the line in mud.h that defines IS_IMMORTAL. Edit it to
suit your preferences. Then rebuild the code.

To give your character all the commands first save and quit. Then locate your 
player file in the ~/swr-2.0/player/ directories. Edit the line that says 
Level changing the number from 1 to 200. Then log back on. Type "holylight"
and "config +roomflags" for full immortal vision.

Oh yeah,
This code is unfinished and buggy...

Enjoy
