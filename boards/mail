We talked briefly about my clan proposal, I thought I would explain a
little more for you, to try and convince you.  Well The Shrekian would be
more of a Reclusive clan, only coming from one planet, not a clan to
dominate the world.  The Clan would revolve around Space Battles, Ships,
and Piracy.  The Shrekian would have only one Planet, Hades, in the Hades
System.  From that planet as their stronghold they would plunder and
pillage other planets.  Now this is excellent RP in my opinion so plz plz
give it a thought.  I would also be a good leader I think, I have a lot of
experience leading clans on SWR base codes.  Whether it was Arsenic
leading the NR 7 months ago, or Acrux leading the empire, or even Nomads,
I have the experience, for I have played this code longer then most.
