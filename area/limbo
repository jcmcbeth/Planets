The New Player Center~
This mud is not yet fully operational... 
  
However it is playable. Just.. very rough around the edges. So, please feel
free to explore and test things. 
  
If you've changed your mind and don't feel like playing please delete your
character with the "suicide" command. 
  
Otherwise, type "enter" to start playing.
